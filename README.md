_KRATOS Multiphysics_ ("Kratos") is a framework for building parallel, multi-disciplinary simulation software, aiming at modularity, extensibility, and high performance. Kratos is written in C++, and counts with an extensive Python interface. More in [Overview](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki/Overview)

**Kratos** is **free** under BSD-4 [license](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki/Licence) and can be used even in comercial softwares as it is. Many of its main applications are also free and BSD-4 licensed but each derived application can have its own propietary license.

# Main Features
**Kratos** is __multiplatform__ and available for __Windows, Linux__ (several distros) and __macOS__.

**Kratos** is __OpenMP__ and __MPI__ parallel and scalable up to thousands of cores.

**Kratos** provides a core which defines the common framework and several application which work like plug-ins that can be extended in diverse fields.
